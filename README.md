## Overview    

Individual-based model (IBM) for *Schistosoma mansoni* parasite and *Biomphalaria spp.* snail host population interactions based on dynamic energy budget (DEB) and transmission model. The model outlines how resource use by a size-structured host population influences population cycles of hosts and parasites. Host and parasite ecology and energetics are captured using a mechanistic energy budget model and interactions among hosts and parasites are captured by a disease tranmission model. Resource use by hosts and thus parasites is modelled by the IBM.  

**Host**  
Hosts incur costs from infection through damage density _delta_ and cumulative hazard rate _H_.      

**Parasite**  
The number of free-living miracidia in the environment is based on a probability function (multinomial distribution) of surviving miracidia, miracidia that successfully infected hosts, and unsuccessful miracidia that died.

## Parameters and variables   

### Individual 
Notation follows the standard DEB notation, except in the following aspects:  
- Rates are indicated with '_rate' rather than a dot  
- '_ee_' is scaled reserve density of hosts in `Netlogo`

## Troubleshooting  
### :pig: For running Netlogo from `R` on Mac OSX. See the [Instructions for Mac OSX](https://github.com/darwinanddavis/SchistoIBM/tree/master/mac) page for a detailed breakdown of the troubleshooting steps.  
:one: [Installing compiler toolchain for Mac OSX](https://thecoatlessprofessor.com/programming/r-compiler-tools-for-rcpp-on-macos/)    
:two: if rJava error, run the following in terminal (src: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/30738974/rjava-load-error-in-rstudio-r-after-upgrading-to-osx-yosemite and #http://paulklemm.com/blog/2015-02-20-run-rjava-with-rstudio-under-osx-10-dot-10/):    
``` {bash}
sudo ln -s $(/usr/libexec/java_home)/jre/lib/server/libjvm.dylib /usr/local/lib 
```  
:three: For running java tests for Mac OSX, see the [**Instructions for Mac OSX**](https://github.com/darwinanddavis/SchistoIBM/tree/master/mac) documentation.
